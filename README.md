### **Process Breakdown**  

#### 1. SQL Data Analysis 
The first step was cleaning and analyzing the dataset using SQL queries.  

- Data Cleaning: 
  ```sql
  SELECT *  
  FROM [HR-Employee-Attrition]  
  WHERE MonthlyIncome IS NOT NULL;

  --HR Attrition Data Cleaning and Normalization
   Inspect the first few rows to understand the structure
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [HR-Employee-Attrition];

  -- Check for null values in each column to identify missing data
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingAge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Department IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingDepartment
  FROM 
    [HR-Employee-Attrition];

  -- Add a unique EmployeeID column to the staging table i.e source table
  ALTER TABLE [HR-Employee-Attrition]
  ADD Employee_ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY;

  -- Check for duplicate rows
  SELECT 
    Employee_ID, 
    COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
  FROM 
    [HR-Employee-Attrition]
  GROUP BY 
    Employee_ID
  HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1; 
  ```  

### **Key Queries:**  
- **Calculate the attrition rate across different departments:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(f.EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) AS AttritionCount,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN f.Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(f.EmployeeID),2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
         FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
         DimDepartment d ON f.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY 
         d.DepartmentName
    ORDER BY AttritionRate DESC;
    ```
  
- **Average monthly income by job role:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    j.JobRoleName,
    ROUND(AVG(f.MonthlyIncome),2) AS AvgMonthlyIncome
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
    DimJobRole j ON f.JobRoleID = j.JobRoleID
    GROUP BY 
    j.JobRoleName
    ORDER BY AvgMonthlyIncome DESC;
    ```

- **Attrition Rate by Age Group:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN '20-29'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 50 AND 59 THEN '50-59'
        ELSE '60+' 
    END AS AgeGroup,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN f.Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(f.EmployeeID),2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN '20-29'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 50 AND 59 THEN '50-59'
        ELSE '60+' 
    END
    ORDER BY 
    AttritionRate DESC;
      ``` 

- **Work-Life Balance vs. Attrition(This query helps identify if a poor work-life balance is correlated with higher attrition rates):**
  ```sql
    SELECT 
    WorkLifeBalance,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS AttritionCount,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(EmployeeID) * 100, 2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition
    GROUP BY 
    WorkLifeBalance
    ORDER BY 
    AttritionRate DESC;
  ```
- **Average Tenure of Employees by Department(Examining the average number of years employees stay in each department):**
  ```sql
   SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName AS Department,
    AVG(f.YearsAtCompany) AS AvgYearsAtCompany
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
    DimDepartment d ON f.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY 
    d.DepartmentName
    ORDER BY 
    AvgYearsAtCompany DESC;
   ```
 - **how does the work enviroment influence attrition rate:**
 ```sql
    SELECT 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) AS AttritionCount,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(EmployeeID) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition
    GROUP BY 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction
    ORDER BY 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction DESC;
   ```

- **SQL Insights:**  
  - Employees earning <$3,000/month showed higher attrition rates.  
  - Work-life balance ratings of 1 or 2 correlated with increased attrition.

2. **Marital Status:** Single employees show a higher attrition rate than married ones.  
3. **Work-Life Balance:** Work-Life Balance is Crucial: Employees with ratings of 1 or 2 (Poor and V.Poor) show a 40% higher attrition rate.
4. **Distance Matters:** Employees commuting >20 km are likelier to leave.  
5. **Job Satisfaction:** Dissatisfied employees rated 1 (Very Disatisfied) have a 35% higher likelihood of leaving.
6. Attrition Rate: High attrition rate observed in specific departments such as Sales and Human Resources.
7. Age Group Impact: Younger employees (Age 20-30) and single employees show higher attrition rates.
8. Job Role Variations: Sales Executives and Lab Technicians have the highest attrition.
9. High-performing employees tend to stay longer when they perceive opportunities for career growth.
10. Employees working overtime are more likely to leave, especially if paired with poor work-life balance (rated 1 or 2).
Retrenchment disproportionately impacts employees with poor work-life balance.


---

## **Recommendations**  
1. **Salary Adjustments:** Improve salaries for employees earning less than $3,000/month.  
2. **Support Work-Life Balance:** Introduce flexible hours and remote work options.  
3. **Targeted Retention Efforts:** Focus on single employees through engagement programs such as surveys, team-building activities, and leadership feedback. 
4. **Commute Incentives:** Provide transportation assistance or offer relocation benefits.
5. Retention Programs: Design and implement data-driven retention programs to target high-risk employee groups.
6. Create mentorship and upskilling programs to engage younger employees.
