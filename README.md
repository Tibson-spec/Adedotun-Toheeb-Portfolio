The first step was cleaning and analyzing the dataset using SQL queries.  

- Data Cleaning: 
  ```sql
  SELECT *  
  FROM [HR-Employee-Attrition]  
  WHERE MonthlyIncome IS NOT NULL;

  --HR Attrition Data Cleaning and Normalization
   Inspect the first few rows to understand the structure
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [HR-Employee-Attrition];

  -- Check for null values in each column to identify missing data
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingAge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Department IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MissingDepartment
  FROM 
    [HR-Employee-Attrition];

  -- Add a unique EmployeeID column to the staging table i.e source table
  ALTER TABLE [HR-Employee-Attrition]
  ADD Employee_ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY;

  -- Check for duplicate rows
  SELECT 
    Employee_ID, 
    COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
  FROM 
    [HR-Employee-Attrition]
  GROUP BY 
    Employee_ID
  HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1; 
  ```  

### **Key Queries:**  
- **Calculate the attrition rate across different departments:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName,
    COUNT(f.EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) AS AttritionCount,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN f.Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(f.EmployeeID),2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
         FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
         DimDepartment d ON f.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY 
         d.DepartmentName
    ORDER BY AttritionRate DESC;
    ```
  
- **Average monthly income by job role:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    j.JobRoleName,
    ROUND(AVG(f.MonthlyIncome),2) AS AvgMonthlyIncome
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
    DimJobRole j ON f.JobRoleID = j.JobRoleID
    GROUP BY 
    j.JobRoleName
    ORDER BY AvgMonthlyIncome DESC;
    ```

- **Attrition Rate by Age Group:**  
    ```sql
    SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN '20-29'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 50 AND 59 THEN '50-59'
        ELSE '60+' 
    END AS AgeGroup,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN f.Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(f.EmployeeID),2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN '20-29'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 50 AND 59 THEN '50-59'
        ELSE '60+' 
    END
    ORDER BY 
    AttritionRate DESC;
      ``` 

- **Work-Life Balance vs. Attrition(This query helps identify if a poor work-life balance is correlated with higher attrition rates):**
  ```sql
    SELECT 
    WorkLifeBalance,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS AttritionCount,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(EmployeeID) * 100, 2) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition
    GROUP BY 
    WorkLifeBalance
    ORDER BY 
    AttritionRate DESC;
  ```
- **Average Tenure of Employees by Department(Examining the average number of years employees stay in each department):**
  ```sql
   SELECT 
    d.DepartmentName AS Department,
    AVG(f.YearsAtCompany) AS AvgYearsAtCompany
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition f
    JOIN 
    DimDepartment d ON f.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY 
    d.DepartmentName
    ORDER BY 
    AvgYearsAtCompany DESC;
   ```
 - **how does the work enviroment influence attrition rate:**
 ```sql
    SELECT 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) AS AttritionCount,
    COUNT(EmployeeID) AS TotalEmployees,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Attrition = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(EmployeeID) AS AttritionRate
    FROM 
    FactEmployeeAttrition
    GROUP BY 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction
    ORDER BY 
    EnvironmentSatisfaction DESC;
   ```

- **SQL Insights:**  
  - Employees earning <$3,000/month showed higher attrition rates.
